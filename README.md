# 3D Orbital Simulation

A simple 3D orbital simulation created using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) in C/C++. This simulation models orbital mechanics to represent objects orbiting around a central body, showcasing the principles of gravity and motion in space.

## Future Features

- Simulate objects in 3D space.
- Adjustable orbital parameters such as velocity and distance.
- Visualization of orbits and trajectories.
- Interactive camera control to explore the simulation.

## Requirements

- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) (for 3D rendering)
- Desktop Development with C++ (for Visual Studio 2022)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rubenill79/3D-orbital-sim.git
   cd 3d-orbital-sim

2. Install Dependencies inside thirdparty folder:

   ```bash
   cd thirdparty
   git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git    

3. Open the solution:

- Open the folder in Visual Studio 2022.
